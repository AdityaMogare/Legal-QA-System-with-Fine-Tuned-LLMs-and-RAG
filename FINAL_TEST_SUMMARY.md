## 🔧 What Was Tested

### 1. Frontend Build Test
```bash
cd frontend
npm install          # ✅ Success - All dependencies installed
npm run build        # ✅ Success - Production build created
```

**Results:**
- ✅ All React components compile correctly
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling applied
- ✅ Modern legal-themed UI ready
- ⚠️ Minor warning about unused variable (non-blocking)

### 2. Backend API Test
```bash
cd backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic requests python-dotenv  # ✅ Success
python main_alternative.py  # ✅ Success - Server running on port 8000
```

**API Endpoint Tests:**
```bash
# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# ✅ Response: {"status":"healthy","model":"Fallback Legal Assistant"}

# Model Info
curl http://localhost:8000/api/model-info
# ✅ Response: Model information returned

# Legal Question Test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are Miranda rights?"}'
# ✅ Response: Detailed legal answer with 200 OK status
```

### 3. Model Integration Test

**Original Issue:** JurisPrae model returned 404 from Hugging Face API

**Solution Implemented:** Created `main_alternative.py` with:
